                <div class="subheaders"> <h3> My Mountain Biking Story </h3> </div>
                <p class="bodyparagraphs"> My mountain biking journey began only a few months ago. In February, I began training three 
                    days a week riding the Pipeline Trail and Sammamish River Trail in Woodinville, Washington 
                    to get in good enough shape to try mountain biking for the first time. I borrowed my aunts 
                    hybrid bike and decided to give the Pipeline hill a shot for the first time. I had 
                    no idea what I had gotten myself into; the Pipeline hill is huge and very steep. I was only able to pedal 
                    about 15 feet up the hill and had push the bike up the rest of the way. 
                    It took at least 20 minutes and a great deal of mental effort to push my bike up the 
                    hill while my calves burned, sweat dripped into my eyes
                    and I gasped for air. Even runners passing me were offering words of encouragement and sympathetic looks. 
                    Over an hour later, I finally made it home and honestly wasn't sure if I was going to have the courage 
                    to ride the pipeline trail again. A few days later I got back on my borrowed bike that was now covered in mud
                    and pedalled up the hill just a little bit farther than the frist time. 
                    I continued training in the rain and even the snow, reminding myself that I only needed to make it 
                    just a little bit farther than the last time. After 6 weeks of riding/walking up 
                    the Pipeline hill, I made it to the top, collapsed on the ground and decided to buy 
                    a mountain bike. If I could do that, I could do anything. Plus after all that hard work, I totally deserved it. </p>

                <p class="bodyparagraphs"> Since purchasing my mountain bike in the middle of March I have been mountain biking
                    at Duthie Hill, Black Diamond and even the grueling and challening 12 mile loop at Tiger Mountain. I work in the 
                    afternoon/evening and like to go mountain biking on the weekdays before work since the trails are usually quiet and 
                    I can use the skill building area at Duthie Hill. </p>

                <p class="bodyparagraphs"> I love to go new places and spend as much of my time as possible outside, exploring new trails 
                    and new places. I love to share my experiences and am active on social media hoping to inspire others to get outside, 
                    enjoy the freshair and living healthier, happier lives. Here are just a few of the places I have explored in the last year:
