                <div class="firstright"> <h2> <em>How It Began </em></h2> 
                <p> My mountain biking journey began only a few months ago. In February, I began training three 
                    days a week riding the Pipeline Trail and Sammamish River Trail in Woodinville, Washington 
                    to get in good enough shape to try mountain biking for the first time. I borrowed my aunts 
                    hybrid bike and decided to give the Pipeline hill a shot for the first time. I had 
                    no idea what I had gotten myself into; the Pipeline hill is huge and very steep. I was only able to pedal 
                    about 15 feet up the hill and had push the bike up the rest of the way. 
                    It took at least 20 minutes and a great deal of mental effort to push my bike up the 
                    hill while my calves burned, sweat dripped into my eyes
                    and I gasped for air. Even runners passing me were offering words of encouragement and sympathetic looks. 
                    Over an hour later, I finally made it home and honestly wasn't sure if I was going to have the courage 
                    to ride the pipeline trail again. A few days later I got back on my borrowed bike that was now covered in mud
                    and pedalled up the hill just a little bit farther than the frist time. 
                    I continued training in the rain and even the snow, reminding myself that I only needed to make it 
                    just a little bit farther than the last time. After 6 weeks of riding/walking up 
                    the Pipeline hill, I made it to the top, collapsed on the ground and decided to buy 
                    a mountain bike. If I could do that, I could do anything. Plus after all that hard work, I totally deserved it. 
                    Since purchasing my mountain bike in the middle of March I have been mountain biking
                    at Duthie Hill, Black Diamond and even the grueling and challening 12 mile loop at Tiger Mountain. I work in the 
                    afternoon/evening and like to go mountain biking on the weekdays before work since the trails are usually quiet and 
                    I can use the skill building area at Duthie Hill. </p> </div>

                <p class="bodyparagraphs"> When I am not working, I spend as much time as possible outside, exploring new trails 
                    and new places. I love to share my experiences and am active on social media hoping to inspire others to get outside, 
                    enjoy the fresh air and live healthier, happier lives. Here are just a few of the places I have explored in the last year: </p> </div>

                    <p class="bodyparagraphs"> Working part-time as a Physical Therapy Aide at a local physical therapy clinic while going to school two nights a week 
                    learning computer programing and web development. This website is actually a project I made for class. Recently choosing to change careers 
                    from healthcare to technology I am working hard to build my skills in web development and aspire to become an IT project manager. Since I have mornings 
                    off work I began volunteering two days a week in a sixth grade classroom at a local elementary school and absolutely love it. One of my favorite hobbies is cooking. 
                    I am a dedicated Sunday meal-prepper and recently completed my first Whole30. I love the Food Channel and follow many food bloggers online for recipe inspiriation. </p>
                    
                <div class="firstright"> <h2> <em> Why I would be a great addition to the Trail Squad </em> </h2> </div>
                    <ul>
                        <li> As a beginner, I have a lot to learn and will take full advantage of the training and coaching offered by the Liv team. 
                            If chosen, I hope to be the most improved member the Trail Squad this year. </li>
                        <li> I love to write and have been told I am an entertaining, humerous and honest blogger and writter. </li>
                        <li> With modest beginnings, I hope to inspire other women who have thought to themselves "I'm too out of shape to mountain bike", 
                            "I'm not coordinated enough", or "Where the heck do I even start?" that anyone can learn to mountain bike. I am living proof!  </li>
                        <li> As you can see from my Pipeline trail story, I am self-motivated and always push myself to become better, stronger and will stop at nothing 
                            to meet my goals. I am up for the challenge and am looking forward to training for an Epic mountaing biking race. Bring it on! </li>
